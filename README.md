# QuickBar Import/Export

This is a simple mod for the game Factorio (v0.17) that allows you to export your current quickbar state as a string and import it in a different save. This is great for sharing your quickbar setup with others or simply moving it from an old save of yours to the new one. Should be compatible with any mods. Currently supports EN, DE and FR localisations.
